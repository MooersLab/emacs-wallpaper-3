# Emacs Keybindings on Desktop Wallpaper

Desktop wallpaper with some common Emacs keybindings. 
This is a first approximation.

# Customization
There is room to add more keybindings in the right column.
You can use the tex file to change the keybindings or add new ones to your liking.
You can change the color of the font; magenta or cyan would provide some jarring contrast.
You can also use a different backdrop figure with the tex file.
You need to have LaTeX installed to compile the tex file, or you can use a webservice like Overleaf to compile the text superimposed on the background image.
You will have to convert the result PDF in a PNG or JPG file for display as wall paper.

The keybindings work with my associated Emacs configuration [file](https://codeberg.org/MooersLab/emacs30init).
You can use the new `--init-directory` flag to run my configuration file with Emacs 29 or Emacs 30.

Some of the keybindings may behave differently with your Emacs configuration.
Enter `C-h k` and the keybinding to check if a keybinding works in your configuration as advertised here.
