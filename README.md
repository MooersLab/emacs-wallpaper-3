# Emacs Keybindings on Desktop Wallpaper

Desktop wallpaper with some common Emacs keybindings. 
This is a first approximation.
There is room to add more keybindings.
You can use the tex file to change the keybindings or add new ones to your liking.
You can also use a different backdrop figure with the tex file.
You need to have LaTeX installed to compile the tex file, or you can use the webservice Overleaf or its ilk.

The keybindings work with my associated Emacs configuration [file](https://codeberg.org/MooersLab/emacs30init).
You can use the new `--init-directory` flag to run my configuration file with Emacs 29 or Emacs 30.

Some of the keybindings may behave differently with your Emacs configuration.
Enter `C-h k` and the keybinding to check if a keybinding works in your configuration as advertised here.
